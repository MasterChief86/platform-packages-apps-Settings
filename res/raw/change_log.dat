- Add new wallpaper mode settings (Settings => Display)
  ** Normal(regular android mode)
  ** Disable System Wallpaper rendering (set as default)
  ** Disable Wallpaper service
  2nd setting will prevent the wallpaper being rendered by system and also freeing resources
   That's the recommended setting you want to use if you are using a launcher that has internal wallpaper rendering
   If you see a black wallpaper that means that your launcher was using system rendering which is not good on our tf101
  3rd setting disables wallpaper completely, depending on your launcher it might be better
